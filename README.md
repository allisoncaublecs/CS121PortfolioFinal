Enjoy my recent projects!! Thank You

Encapsulation - Bundling data and methods in a class and restricting access to some of the object's data, usually via getters and setters.
Abstraction - Hiding complex details and showing only the necessary features of an object or method.
Inheritance - A class can inherit properties and behaviors from another class, enabling code reuse.
Polymorphism - The ability for different objects to respond to the same method in different ways.


I watched the clean code video, I liked that at 4:14 in the video that ChatGpt was mentioned. I was scared orginally as a CS major with this new knowledge, but working on the business side of technology I understand how itll never replace human coders in the near future due to all the secuirty risk and that it often does not product complex code or have the ability to understand processes like chunky SQL queries and API calls as it is unable to see the databases. I think it is cool to know that humans have a better grasp for now despite the attention and trend around it.
